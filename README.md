# Game Of Life

Simple ES6 implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life).  
To limit inaccuracies due to the life field being finite, the edges of this field are connected (left with right, top with bottom).  
The random color of the cells is purely cosmetic.
